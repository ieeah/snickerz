# A shoes "Store"

This is just a project I'm building to practice with React.

The layout has been completely designed by me, but since I'm not a designer probably it isn't really well done.

#### Every product, brand, shoes (or anything else) is exclusive property of it's owner, I used them to have some real assets to put in the store to make it more realistic.
### Any copyright infrigiment wasn't intended.
#### In case you're a copyright owner and you need me to put down your product from this project, let me know [here.](mailto:lbnfnc90@gmail.com)
